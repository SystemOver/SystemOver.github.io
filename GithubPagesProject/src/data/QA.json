        "Question":"What is your Real Name?",
        "Answer":"<p>For most obvious i wont disclose my real legal Name publicy, but my First Name is: <ul class='list-disc ml-8'><li>Stefan (German)</li><li>Steven / Steve (English)</li><li>Стефан (Bulgarian)</li></ul> <br>However, you can adress me by System, System_over (idk why this one), or anything else that makes sense if you want but i dont really care. <br> <br> PS: Also if you do know my actual full Name, i am kindly asking you to not leak or post it somewhere, since it would put me and my close surroundings into the danger of being harresed, stalked, and who knows what else people do on the Internet. (Also Doxxing someone without their consent, is against Twitch guilines)</p>"

    {
        "Question":"Why 'System_Over'?",
        "Answer":"<p>The tldr: the extended version of <b>System_Over</b> is <b>System_Overload</b> which represents my 'computerlike thinking' (System) and me not being able to do multiple things at once (Overload). <br> The Name originated when i 'rebranded' myself (i hated my old Gamertag, and yes i am aware that my current one isnt better)</p>"

        "Question":"Do i publish my Software/Scripts",
        "Answer":"<p>Currently <b>no</b>, since i do not know what the safest approach to publishing it online is. I am not only referring to myself here in the sense of getting hacked, but also for you, because i dont know how to guarantee that the script that you downloaded is actually 'my' script.</p>"
